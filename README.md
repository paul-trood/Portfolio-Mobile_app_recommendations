# Google Play and Apple iOS App Recommendations

### Scenario:

We're data analysts for an app development company in the United States. Over the last five years we have established a respectably sized customer based, but there are still opportunities to grow our customer base and increase revenue. We want to develop a new app that is a stand-alone free version that our customers will enjoy. To generate revenue, we may employ in-app purchases or a subscription-based model. 

For reference the six most used app monetization strategies (for free apps) are:

* App advertising
* In-app purchases
* Subscriptions
* Selling merchandise
* Sponsorships
* Collecting and selling data
   
To minimize risks and overhead, our validation strategy for an app idea has three steps:

* Build a minimal Android version of the app, and add it to Google Play.
* If the app has a good response from users, we develop it further.
* If the app is profitable after six months, we build an iOS version of the app and add it to the App Store.

Since we want to develop a new app for Google Play and iOS, the app profiles we pick need to be successful for both markets.

## Method
Before we do any visualization or making and recommendations, we first need to do the following:
* Load in the datasets
* Clean data
* Exploratory Data Analysis

## Recommendations
To make sound business decisions we need to perform a few tasks during analysis:
* Review potential customer base, what are consumers downloading?
* Gauge our competition, what types of apps are our competitors developing?

## Datasets:
We'll be using two sample datasets from Kaggle.com to save time and resources of having to gather millions of records. 

Google Play dataset is comprised of about 10,000 apps.
For this dataset we will be using the terms android, play store, or google interchangeably to reference Google Play Store.
